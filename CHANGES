	* Added credit for Ian Jeffray (C version) and Scott Weston (Python 
	  version), their code made it much easier to get this working while
	  I was also trying to grok USB and Device::USB.

	* Added more testing.

	* Added a notice that this version + v0.01 are buggy.

	* Sending init strings for every command now fixes the bug. Thanks JS!
